  <p>The Elevador open space hosts events that welcome everyone. Our vision is to create a safe space for creative activities that are open to everyone, and are welcoming and affordable. These are the key words of the concept. Activities can be workshops, presentations, classes, and small exhibitions in the area of technology, art, music, writing, film and video, language teaching etc. In addition, we want to make the space available to others for activities that fall within the Elevador concept.</p>
  <p>We aim to provide a harassment-free experience for all, regardless of gender, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, age, or religion. We do not tolerate harassment of our members and visitors in any form. Sexual language and imagery is not appropriate during any of our events, including talks, workshops, or afterwards, including posts on any online media. Members of the Elevador Meetup group violating these rules may be expelled from the event and any future events at the discretion of the organisers.</p>
  <p>Harassment includes offensive verbal comments related to gender, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, religion, sexual images in public spaces, deliberate intimidation, stalking, following, harassing photography or recording, sustained disruption of talks or other events, inappropriate physical contact, and unwelcome sexual attention. The Elevador Code of Conduct applies to everyone who uses the space in any way, also when communicating about the Elevador and those involved in any way.</p>
